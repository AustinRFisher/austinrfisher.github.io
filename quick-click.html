            <strong>Problem:</strong> Americans and Canadians collectively throw 1 billion toothpaste tubes into landfills every year. These take hundreds of years to degrade,  otherwise polluting the environment when burned. Toothpaste tubes contain excess product waste, and are not recyclable.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Create and market a re-usable toothpaste tube with recyclable inserts, all made of 100% biodegradable materials.<br/><br/>

          <p>The project was to choose a FMCG, and create an alternative solution which reduces waste and creates a circular economy — where old products are used in the production of new products.<br/><br/>
            Choosing an idea was the most difficult part. At first, we wanted to create an apartment-building recycling program, then an intelligent disposal unit which auto-filtered recyclables, but both projects were not feasible.<br/><br/>
            So, we scaled down. <em>Focus on one product instead of all of them.</em><br/><br/>
            <strong>First, we mapped out what our typical days looked like, then brainstormed problems with objects we used every day. This helped find a product worth innovating.</strong>

          <p>After filtering down daily tasks, we had two options: toothpaste or coffee. Toothpaste hadn’t changed for 100 years — the tubes were persistent against technological advancement, so we thought an update was well overdue.<br/><br/>
            Thus, the idea for Quick Click was formed — a refillable, fully recyclable toothpaste tube. We then laid out the various questions we needed answered:
          </p>
          <div class="col-12">
            <ol>
              <li>How would users refill the product?</li>
              <li>How would the product dispense toothpaste?</li>
              <li>How do we market our final product?</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h1 class="text-center margin-fix"><span class="header">Q1: Refilling?</span></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-9">
          <p> We explored two financial models: one where the user had to fill up at a dispenser, and one where the user purchased refill cartridges separately. For the first model, we interviewed a dentist. We asked: <em>Does it make sense to include refillable toothpaste dispensers in the dentist’s office, given that most dentist offices give out free toothpaste tubes and tootbrushes already?</em><br/><br/>
            The consensus was <em>no</em> — dentists changed toothpaste providers periodically, sparking compatability issues. Additionally, a communal refill station would pose a great health risk to its users, regardless of its location (drug stores and grocery stores).<br/><br/>
            <strong>We concluded that users couldn’t bring their refillable proucts to a communal dispenser.</strong> The only other way to supply toothpaste refills would be for consumers to purchase them, much like how users purchase toothpaste tubes currently.
          </p>
          <img style="margin:20px 0px 36px 0px;"class="img-fluid" src="images/qc-5.JPG">
          <p>Our next questions were: <em>“Should users buy toothpaste in bulk, or just in the amount they need?”</em> and <em>“How is the tube going to function?”</em> These would determine the shape and size of the device. <strong>To answer both of these questions, I conducted some user testing.</strong>
          </p>

        <div class="container">
          <h1 class="text-center margin-fix"><span class="header">Q2: Dispensing?</span></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-9">
          <p>I wrote and executed a user testing session with three components — survey, direct observation, and interview. <strong>Here’s a summary of the test directly from the user testing session:</strong>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-lg-10 quote-box">
          <p class="quote-text"> “On Monday January 30th, 2017, at the University of Waterloo’s Stratford Campus, I held the user test for Quick Click individually with seven participants.<br/><br/>
            First, users were surveyed regarding toothpaste use, its pros and cons, how much they purchased at once, and their thoughts on our two potential refill models. This was to understand where users believed the problems existed with current toothpaste tubes, and their preference towards bulk or small refills when purchasing.<br/><br/>
            For the Direct Observation test, users were instructed to handle 6 shapes and determine which felt most natural in their hand. The shapes were cylinders, rectangular prisms, and triangular prisms of two sizes each. Users were then asked to place a dispensing button on their shape of choice where they felt was most natural. This test determined the physical form of Quick Click.<br/><br/>
            For the Interview, I showed five different design sketches of Quick Click to our users. Users were required to describe the basic functionality of each design, how the toothpaste would be dispensed, and how they would refill the product. This determined which dispense/refill methods was easiest to understand, in order to give an optimal user experience.<br/><br/>
            At the end of each test, the participant was rewarded with a donut for their time.”

          <p><strong>From our results, we concluded:</strong>

          <div class="col-12">
            <ol style="margin:20px 0px 36px 0px;">
              <li>Users consistently used double the required amount of toothpaste. Users preferred inserts over buying bulk due to convenience and cleanliness. Price points would ultimately determine user decision.</li>
              <li>Users favoured cylinders with flat caps the most. They were easiest to use, could be stored in multiple ways, and didn’t take up any more space than a regular toothpaste tube.</li>
              <li>A button on top was most preferred (like a syringe). It could be used one-handed, and greatly reduced the chances of accidental triggering.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>Since the button functioned best on the end of the product, a pressurized mechanism would be used to push toothpaste down with each click, dispensing the exact appropriate amount onto the toothbrush.<br/><br/>
            Great care was taken to ensure we calculated the correct amount of toothpaste people need to use. <em>(Hint: You're probably using too much)</em>

          <h1 class="text-center margin-fix"><span class="header">Q3: Marketing?</span></h1>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-9">
          <p>We ran into a problem with efficiency. It seemed our product worked so well that it would actually <strong>damage</strong> the toothpaste industry. People would be spending less on toothpaste every year with the 200% efficiency rate.<br/><br/>
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> <em>If the Quick Click is more efficient, and lasts twice as long as a regular toothpaste tube of the same size, why would Colgate sell it?</em><br/><br/>
            Quick Click inserts needed to be double the price of regular toothpaste tubes. However, our users made it clear they were <strong>not</strong> willing to pay double the price for a more efficient system even if it balanced out over time, due to the extra cost of the physical unit at $15.<br/><br/>
            One marketing strategy to combat this would be to distribute Quick Click units to dentists to give away for free to clients. The campaign would cause Colgate to intially lose money, but it would put units in the hands of customers, motivating them to purchase refill units from then on.
